This is a simple script I wrote to create Arch Linux images.

I found myself creating images more than I expected, so I wrote this script to build them for me. I figured it was worth the time it would take to create the script, as it only takes a few minutes to run. Entering commands to build an image manually was rather tedius after a while.

This script requires root privileges. You may or may not have luck using sudo to run this script.

The build.sh script in the directory will build the image for you, when run as root.

It is best to clone this repository, then copy the files within over to a new directory where you will build your images, unless I some day create a GitHub action to build images upon a manual run and publish them to a release.

The compress.sh script will compress the built image.
